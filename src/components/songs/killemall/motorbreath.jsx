        <h4>[Verse 1]</h4>
        <p>
          Living and dying, laughing and crying
          <br />
          Once you have seen it, you&apos;ll never be the same
          <br />
          Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
          <br />
          Hard and it&apos;s heavy, it&apos;s dirty and mean

        <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
        <p>
          Motorbreath, it&apos;s how I live my life
          <br />
          I can&apos;t take it any other way
          <br />
          Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
          <br />
          It is going to take your breath away

        <h4>[Verse 2]</h4>
        <p>
          Don&apos;t stop for nothing, it&apos;s full speed or nothing
          <br />
          I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
          <br />
          Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
          <br />
          Sending the shivers up and down my spine

          Those people who tell you not to take chances
          <br />
          They are all missing on what life&apos;s about
          <br />
          You only live once, so take hold of the chance
          <br />
          Don&apos;t end up like others, the same song and dance
        </p>
