          Down in the depths of my fiery home
          <br />
          The summons bell will chime
          <br />
          Tempting you and all the Earth
          <br />
          To join our sinful kind
          <br />
          There is a job to be done and I&apos;m the one
          <br />
          You people make me do it
          <br />
          Now it&apos;s time for your fate and I won&apos;t hesitate
          <br />
          To pull you down into this pit

        <p>
          With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
          <br />
          The end is closing in
          <br />
          Feeding on the minds of man
          <br />
          And from their souls within
          <br />
          My disciples all shout to search you out
          <br />
          And they always shall obey
          <br />
          Follow me now, my child, not the meek or the mild
          <br />
          But do just as I say
