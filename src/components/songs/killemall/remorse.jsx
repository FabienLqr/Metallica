          No thought to even what we&apos;ve done

          Attack! Bullets are flying, people are dying
          <br />
          With madness surrounding, all hell&apos;s breaking loose
          <br />
          Soldiers are hounding, bodies are mounting
          <br />
          Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
          <br />
          With war machines going, blood starts to flowing
          <br />
          No mercy given to anyone here
          <br />
          The furious fighting, swords are like lightning
          <br />
          It all becomes frightening, you know death is near
