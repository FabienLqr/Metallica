        <h4>[Verse 1]</h4>
        <p>
          Thunder and lightning, the gods take revenge
          <br />
          Senseless destruction
          <br />
          Victims of fury are cowardly now
          <br />
          Running for safety
          <br />
          Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
          <br />
          Leaving the virgin
          <br />
          Suicide running as if it were free
          <br />
          Ripping and tearing
        </p>

          Metal militia for your sacrifice
