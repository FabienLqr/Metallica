          By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
          <br />
          Better raise your ears
          <br />
          The sound of hooves knock at your door
          <br />
          Lock up your wife and children now
          <br />
          It&apos;s time to wield the blade
          <br />
          For now you&apos;ve got some company
        </p>

          he horsemen are drawing nearer
          <br />
          On the leather steeds they ride
          <br />
          They&apos;ve come to take your life
          <br />
          On through the dead of night
          <br />
          With the four horsemen ride
          <br />
          Or choose your fate and die

          You&apos;ve been dying since the day you were born
          <br />
          You know it&apos;s all been planned
          <br />
          The quartet of deliverance rides
          <br />
          A sinner once a sinner twice
          <br />
          No need for confession now
          <br />
          &apos;Cause now you have got the fight of your life

          Time! Has taken its toll on you
          <br />
          The lines that crack your face
          <br />
          Famine! Your body, it has torn through
          <br />
          Withered in every place
          <br />
          Pestilence! For what you&apos;ve had to endure
          <br />
          And what you have put others through
          <br />
          Death! Deliverance for you for sure
          <br />
          Now there&apos;s nothing you can do

          So gather round, young warriors, now
          <br />
          And saddle up your steeds
          <br />
          Killing scores with demon swords
          <br />
          Now&apos;s the death of doers of wrong
          <br />
          Swing the judgment hammer down
          <br />
          Safely inside armor: blood, guts, and sweat
