          We&apos;re scanning the scene
          <br />
          In the city tonight <br />
          We&apos;re
          <br />
          looking for you <br />
          To start up a fight <br />
          There&apos;s an evil feeling <br />
          In our brains <br />
          But it&apos;s nothing new <br />
          You know it drives us insane

          Our brains are on fire
          <br /> With the feeling to kill
          <br /> And it won&apos;t go away
          <br /> Until our dreams are fulfilled

          There is only one thing
          <br /> On our minds <br />
          Don&apos;t try running away
